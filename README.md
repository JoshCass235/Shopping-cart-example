# Shopping-cart-example
This is a simple shopping cart using React and Typescript. 
Future additions to the project could include:
1. a more dynamic current promotion system
2. populating pages with more details (e.g Deals)
3. overall restyle (Kept it basic and simple)
4. add redux and a store would simplify some code
5. adding a .net backend and introducing a db
